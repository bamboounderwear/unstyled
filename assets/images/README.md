# Images Directory

This directory contains all image assets for the Brockmann website.

## Image Optimization

For optimal performance:

- Compress all JPG and PNG images
- Use WebP format when possible for better compression
- Use appropriate dimensions (avoid oversized images)
- Include alt text when implementing images in HTML

## External Images

Currently, the site uses placeholder images from placehold.co. When replacing these with actual images:

1. Add the image files to this directory
2. Update the image paths in the HTML files
3. Ensure proper attribution for any stock photos or third-party images
